              I started my career in 2019 and have been working in the
              field ever since.
              I am passionate about creating things. My love for creation began at an early age,
              where I would often be found sketching and drawing.
              Though I haven't had much time for sketching in the
              past two years due to my studies in software development,
              I have found that my passion for design has transformed into a digital form.

            My interest in web development began when I discovered my love for
            designing websites and creating intuitive user experiences.
            Since then, I have been developing modern and clean websites
            using frameworks such as
            <span className="text-fun-pink font-bold text-lime-500">{" Next.js, React.js"}</span> and
            <span className="text-fun-pink font-bold text-lime-500">{" Node.js"}</span> .
            I am also well-versed in <span className="text-fun-pink font-bold text-lime-500">{" object-oriented programming, data structures and alogrithms, "}</span>
            and continuously strive to
            improve my knowledge in the field of
            <span className="text-fun-pink font-bold text-lime-500">{" user experience design "}</span> .
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a recent graduate, I specialize in full stack development,
            with expertise in languages such as
            <span className="text-fun-pink font-bold text-lime-500">

            I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy.
